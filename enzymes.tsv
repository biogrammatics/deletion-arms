# Available Blunt-Cutting Restriction Enzymes for Knockout Construct Design
# This file lists enzymes that:
#   1. Cut with blunt ends
#   2. Do NOT cut any of the cloning vectors (pR-B, pR-H, pR-N, pR-Z)
#
# Format: Enzyme_Name <tab> Recognition_Sequence <tab> Cost_Tier <tab> NEB_Price <tab> NEB_Units <tab> Notes
# Recognition sequence uses ⇅ to mark cut site
# Cost tiers based on cost per unit:
#   inexpensive: < $0.05/unit
#   moderate: $0.05 - $0.10/unit
#   expensive: > $0.10/unit
# NEB_Price: Price in USD for the catalog size
# NEB_Units: Number of units in the catalog size
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
#
# IUPAC Degenerate Base Codes:
#   R = A or G    Y = C or T    M = A or C    K = G or T
#   S = G or C    W = A or T    N = any base
#
# Cost per unit = NEB_Price / NEB_Units (lower is better for prioritization)
